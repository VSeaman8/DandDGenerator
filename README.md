# DandDGenerator
A fun frontend project designed to quickly generate Dungeons and Dragons characters for inspiration. This project aims to be visually pleasing while allowing me to practice calling and randomizing data from an API.

### Project Purpose and Goal

The goal of this project is to practice randomizing data from an API and to create an entire project from scratch, including the business case.

### Web Stack and Explanation

For this iteration, I am using React. Although this could be done with pure HTML, I chose React to future-proof the website and allow for additional functionality later, such as saving created characters and implementing a global login.

### Problems and Thought Process

Initially, I created a business case to practice project management, which helped me plan future iterations of the website. For now, the website will only generate a randomized character, without allowing user input. This iteration focuses on ensuring that all pieces of data work together, as there is a lot of data to manipulate (around 30-40 individual pieces). Writing the business case and creating wireframes in Figma revealed that what seemed simple in concept was more complex in reality, particularly in displaying each piece of data correctly and efficiently calling and randomizing a large amount of information from the API.

### Current Status
Most of the static work has been done on the website. Ability scores and modifiers are now randomised. The next task is to work on how to call and randomise data from API
